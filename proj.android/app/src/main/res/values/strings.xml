    <string name="card2_text">Welcome to the Coco Slice! \n\nThis project allows you to run Cocos2d-x (current version is 3.17.1) inside the separate android fragment. By default, cocos only let you start its rendering inside Cocos2dxActivity and occupy all window (means it\'s impossible to mix native android and cocos). \n\nBut what if you want to insert some small staff like spine or 3d particle effect to your existed android app?</string>
    <string name="card3_text">Well, now you can!</string>
    <string name="card3_text2">Coco Slice brings new Cocos2dxFragment class, which starts Cocos on GLSurfaceView inside the Fragment and handle all the lifecycle. CardView above contains exactly such fragment with skeletal animation and particle. </string>
